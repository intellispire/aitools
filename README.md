Python tools for working with generative AI projects.

These tools are used to play with AI, specifically OpenAI API's. Many of them shamelessly borrowed from 
https://github.com/daveshap/ David Shapiro.

Helps to avoid copy & paste.

Note: The tools expect your OpenAI key to be available in the env, e.g.:
`export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-YOURKEY'`
